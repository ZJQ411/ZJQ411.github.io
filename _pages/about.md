This is the front page of a generic Github pages website that uses the [简历](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own images and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! You can also see [my own personal website](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
